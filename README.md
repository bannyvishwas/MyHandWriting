## Installation

The entire code in written in pure python using only its builtin packages. So, there is nothing to install (apart from python)

## Usage example

Paste the below text into "content.txt" as an example.

```
plain text is by default in blue color
#enclosing text between two hashes will make it black#
$        having a dollar symbol doesn't strip leading white spaces
$    #can also combine the dollar and hash to get indented text in black color#
```

run the below command to generate page.html file that contains the generated handwritten text.

```Python
python3 writer.py
```
