Run MakeSet.py to make your own letter sets.
```Python
python MakeSet.py
```
Paste the below text into "content.txt" as an example.

```
plain text is by default in blue color
#enclosing text between two hashes will make it black#
$        having a dollar symbol doesn't strip leading white spaces
$    #can also combine the dollar and hash to get indented text in black color#
```
